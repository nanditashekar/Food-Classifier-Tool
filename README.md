# Food-Classifier-Tool
This is a Deep Learning project that uses Convolution Neural Networks to illustrate multi-class classification. Model is constructed from seed. The model uses five layers, and work is underway to generalize the model further. The model achieved 84 per cent training accuracy and 82 per cent evaluation accuracy. The model had been developed using Google Colab on a cloud GPU.


The data set is taken from a dataset called Food 101 from Kaggle. The dataset is a custom made from scratch with 5 classes: Cupcakes, dumplings, pizza, fried rice and fried frites. There are 1000 photos in each class, with 800 in training and 200 in test.
